# Polishing the AI Loading Experience

The Site Evolution page has had streaming animations since v2.5.0. Content types character-by-character, skeleton lines shrink as text appears, and a pulsing dot indicates loading. It worked. But it felt... mechanical.

Today's changes are about making it feel *alive*.

## The Inspiration

I stumbled on a [tweet by Pallav Mac](https://x.com/pallavmac/status/1897491460636778693) showing the variety of "thinking" words Claude Code uses while processing:

> Thinking... Analyzing... Pondering... Cogitating... Percolating... Noodling...

It's such a small thing, but it gives the AI personality. Instead of robotic "Loading...", you get "Marinating..." or "Vibing..." - words that feel human.

I stole this idea.

## Before: Static and Predictable

The old loading flow:
1. Show "Thinking..."
2. Switch to "Analyzing..."
3. Switch to "Loading..."
4. Start streaming content

Every card did the same dance, in the same order. Predictable. Boring.

## After: Random and Playful

Now each card picks a random word from a pool of 15+ options:

```ts
const THINKING_WORDS = [
  'Thinking...',
  'Analyzing...',
  'Pondering...',
  'Cogitating...',
  'Percolating...',
  'Noodling...',
  'Musing...',
  'Brewing...',
  'Vibing...',
  'Mulling...',
  'Conjuring...',
  'Simmering...',
  'Ruminating...',
  'Marinating...',
];
```

One card might show "Cogitating...", the next "Percolating...". The randomness feels more organic.

## Animated Dots

The dots now animate: `.` → `..` → `...` → `.`

Instead of static "Thinking...", you see the dots cycle, suggesting ongoing thought. It's a small touch that adds life.

```ts
// Animate dots: . → .. → ... → .
useEffect(() => {
  if (phase !== 'status') return;
  if (statusCharIndex < statusWord.length) return;

  const dotInterval = setInterval(() => {
    setDotCount((prev) => (prev % 3) + 1);
  }, 400);

  return () => clearInterval(dotInterval);
}, [phase, statusCharIndex, statusWord.length]);
```

## Snappier Timing

The old timing felt sluggish:
- 1800ms status phase
- 12ms per character

New timing:
- 600ms status phase
- 8ms per character

The result is noticeably faster without feeling rushed. Content appears quickly enough to maintain engagement.

## Auto-Collapsing Chapters

The bigger UX improvement: completed chapters now collapse automatically.

### The Problem

When all chapters stream fully, the page becomes a wall of text. Users who want to focus on Chapter 3 have to scroll past Chapters 1 and 2.

### The Solution

After a chapter finishes streaming, if it's "completed" status, it collapses to a single-line summary. Click to expand. Click again to collapse. The header row becomes the toggle.

### Manual Navigation Mode

Clicking a chapter in the sidebar nav now:
1. Collapses all other chapters
2. Expands the selected chapter
3. Scrolls smoothly to it

This creates a focused reading experience - you see one chapter at a time, with collapsed summaries above and below.

## Changelog Auto-Scroll

The Changelog tab also got love. On mount, it now auto-scrolls to the most relevant item:
- If there's an "in-progress" item, scroll to it
- Otherwise, scroll to the next "planned" item

The scroll uses a custom easing function (ease-out cubic) for that smooth, intentional feel.

## Storybook Improvements

All these changes are testable in Storybook. The streaming story got better controls:

| Control | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `typingSpeed` | Characters per millisecond (lower = faster) |
| `statusDuration` | How long "Thinking..." shows |
| `staggerDelay` | Gap between cards completing |
| `cardCount` | Number of chapters to render |

## The Impact

These changes don't add features. They don't fix bugs. They make the existing experience feel more polished:

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Status text | Predictable cycle | Random, playful words |
| Dots | Static | Animated (. → .. → ...) |
| Timing | 1800ms + 12ms/char | 600ms + 8ms/char |
| Completed chapters | Always expanded | Auto-collapse |
| Sidebar nav | Scroll only | Expand + scroll |
| Changelog | Static on load | Auto-scroll to active |

None of these are features users asked for. But combined, they make the page feel cared-for. That's what polish is.

## Why It Matters

Portfolio sites are showcases. If the *showcase* has jank, what does that say about the work inside?

These tweaks take the loading experience from "works" to "delights". And that's worth an afternoon of work.
