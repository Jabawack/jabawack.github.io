# Why I Added a Blog to My Portfolio

A portfolio shows *what* you built. But it rarely answers *why*.

After rebuilding this site from a 2017 jQuery page to Next.js 15, I realized something was missing. Each version had stories behind it - decisions made, trade-offs considered, lessons learned. Those stories were lost in commit messages nobody reads.

## The Problem

When I added the Design System (v2.4.0), I spent days deciding between Storybook and Docusaurus. When I chose MUI v7 over Tailwind, there were reasons. When I implemented the Site Evolution timeline, I wanted to explain the journey from jQuery to React to Next.js.

But where do these stories live?

- **README files** - Too technical, buried in the repo
- **Portfolio cards** - Too brief, focused on outcomes
- **Social media** - Too ephemeral, lost in feeds

I needed a place to document the *journey*, not just the destination.

## The Solution: A Blog That Lives With the Code

The blog isn't separate from the portfolio - it's part of it. Each post connects to a version:

| Version | Feature | Blog Post |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| v2.4.0 | Design System | Why Storybook over Docusaurus |
| v2.5.0 | MDX Blog | This post |
| v2.6.0 | orbit-lab | Building a 3D flight tracker |

This creates a living changelog. When someone sees "v2.5.0" on the Site Evolution page, they can read the full story.

## Why MDX?

I considered several approaches:

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Notion/CMS | Edit anywhere | External dependency, syncing issues |
| Markdown | Simple | No React components |
| **MDX** | Markdown + React, version controlled | Requires local editing |

MDX won because:

1. **Posts live in the repo** - Same git history as the code
2. **No external services** - No CMS to maintain or pay for
3. **React components** - Can embed interactive demos in posts
4. **Type-safe frontmatter** - Schema validation for metadata

## What This Enables

With the blog in place, I can now:

- **Document decisions** as I make them, not months later
- **Show before/after** with screenshots and code comparisons
- **Link versions to stories** - each release has context
- **Share technical deep-dives** that don't fit in portfolio cards

## The First Story

The next post will document the orbit-lab project - a 3D flight tracker I'm building with Three.js and deck.gl. Instead of just showing a portfolio card with a screenshot, I'll share:

- Why I chose deck.gl over raw Three.js
- The challenge of rendering 10,000+ flight paths
- Performance optimizations that made it usable
- What I learned about WebGL along the way

That's the kind of content a portfolio card can't capture.

## Looking Forward

This blog will grow with the portfolio. Each new feature gets documented. Each technical decision gets explained. The portfolio becomes not just a showcase, but a story.

If you're building your own portfolio, consider adding a blog - not for SEO or traffic, but as a record of your journey. Future you will thank present you.
