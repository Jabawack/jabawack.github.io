# Redesigning the Donation Mentoring Portfolio Page

My portfolio project pages were boring. Screenshot, tech stack, link to live site. Done.

That format tells visitors *what* I built but not *why* it matters or *how* I think. So I redesigned the [Donation Mentoring portfolio page](/portfolio/donation-mentoring/) to tell the full story.

## The Problem with My Old Portfolio Pages

Most of my project pages followed a predictable pattern:

1. Project title and description
2. Screenshot
3. Tech stack badges
4. Link to live site

This works for a quick overview, but it doesn't differentiate. Every portfolio looks like this. It doesn't show how I approach problems or make decisions.

## What I Changed

### BentoBox Component for Key Metrics

Instead of a bullet list of features, I created a new **BentoBox component** to display project metrics at a glance.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

The component supports three visual variants:

| Variant | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Default** | Subtle background with border emphasis |
| **Glass** | Frosted glass effect with backdrop blur |
| **Gradient** | Soft gradient background |

Each card can span multiple columns (`colSpan`) or rows (`rowSpan`) for flexible layouts. My contribution spans two columns to stand out, while metrics like "30+ Mentors" and "1 click booking" stay compact.

The hover state adds a subtle lift animation and glow effect, making the grid feel interactive without being distracting.

### Narrative Structure for Version Cards

Each version of the project now follows a consistent structure:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **The Challenge** | What problem this version solved |
| **Pain Points** | Real friction users experienced |
| **The Solution** | How we addressed it |
| **Key Decisions** | Technical choices and rationale |
| **Impact** | What changed for users |
| **Learning** | Takeaways for future work |

This mirrors how product teams actually think. Instead of listing features, it tells the story of *why* decisions were made. Recruiters and collaborators can see my problem-solving process, not just the output.

### User Journey Visualization

Instead of describing the platform in paragraphs, I added a visual flow diagram showing the user journey in five steps. Visitors can understand how the platform works at a glance.

### Storybook Documentation

The BentoBox component includes comprehensive Storybook stories demonstrating:

- All three variants (default, glass, gradient)
- Different color schemes (cyan, emerald, violet, coral, gold, mint)
- Various grid configurations
- The actual Donation Mentoring metrics as a real-world example

This makes it easy to reuse the component in future projects and lets others understand its capabilities through the [design system](/portfolio/design-system/).

## Image Optimization

While updating the page, I also converted all site images from PNG to JPG. The file size reduction was significant:

| Image | Before (PNG) | After (JPG) | Reduction |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| current | 5.7 MB | 118 KB | 98% |
| v1 | 12.3 MB | 117 KB | 99% |
| v2 | 20 MB | 77 KB | 99.6% |

This wasn't just for the Donation Mentoring page—I applied this across the entire site. Faster load times, better Core Web Vitals.

## Why This Matters for Portfolios

A good portfolio page should:

- **Show thinking, not just output** - Anyone can list features. Showing *why* you made decisions demonstrates judgment.
- **Tell a story** - Projects evolve. Showing that evolution proves you can iterate and learn.
- **Be scannable** - Recruiters spend seconds on each page. Visual hierarchy matters.
- **Be documented** - Storybook stories make components reusable and discoverable.

The old page was a feature list. The new page is a case study.
