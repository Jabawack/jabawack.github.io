# Respecting User Time: Click to Skip

Here's an uncomfortable truth: that beautiful streaming animation I built? It's annoying on repeat visits.

The first time someone sees text typing character-by-character, it's delightful. The second time, it's tolerable. The third time, they're wondering why they can't just *see the content*.

I was that user. Testing my own site, watching the same animation play for the 50th time. Waiting. And waiting.

## The Empathy Gap

When I built the streaming animation, I was thinking like a developer: *"This looks cool. The timing feels right. Ship it."*

I wasn't thinking like a user who:
- Has already seen this page before
- Just wants to find specific information
- Is on a slow connection and sees content trickle in
- Has limited time and patience

That's an empathy gap. I optimized for *first impression* and ignored *every other visit*.

## The Realization

Video intros have "Skip" buttons. Podcasts have "Skip 30s" buttons. YouTube has "Skip Ad". Every piece of media that respects users gives them control over their time.

Why should my portfolio be different?

The streaming animation is ~10-15 seconds long. That's an eternity in web time. Users shouldn't be held hostage by my design choices.

## The Solution: Click Anywhere to Skip

Simple, intuitive, no explanation needed:

**Click anywhere on the content area → animation completes instantly.**

No buttons. No settings. No "Skip animation" checkbox in some buried menu. Just click.

### Why Click Instead of a Button?

A "Skip" button would:
- Add visual clutter
- Require users to find and target it
- Feel like an afterthought

Click-anywhere says: *"We know. Just click."*

It's the same pattern as clicking through a slideshow or dismissing a modal. Users already know it.

## The Transition Matters

Instant cuts feel jarring. When you skip, the content doesn't just *appear* - it fades up with a subtle stagger.

Each chapter card:
1. Fades from 0 to 100% opacity
2. Slides up 12 pixels
3. Staggers 100ms after the previous card

The whole skip takes ~600ms. Fast enough to feel instant, smooth enough to feel intentional.

```tsx
const fadeUp = keyframes`
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(12px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
`;

// Applied with stagger based on chapter index
sx={{
  animation: `${fadeUp} 0.4s ease-out both`,
  animationDelay: `${chapterIndex * 100}ms`,
}}
```

## The Hint

During the animation, a subtle hint appears at the top:

> *Click anywhere to skip animation*

It's text.disabled color, 70% opacity. Visible if you're looking, invisible if you're watching the animation. Once you skip (or the animation completes), it disappears.

## What Doesn't Trigger Skip

- **Clicking chapter headers**: Toggles expand/collapse, doesn't skip
- **Clicking sidebar navigation**: Navigates to chapter, doesn't skip
- **Clicking after animation completes**: Nothing happens (correct behavior)

Event propagation is handled with `stopPropagation()` on interactive elements. The skip only triggers on "empty" clicks.

## No Memory, By Design

The skip doesn't persist. Refresh the page, animation plays again.

Why? Because:
- LocalStorage for this feels heavy-handed
- Users might *want* to see it again
- First-time visitors should get the full experience
- It's one click to skip - not a burden

If users consistently skip, that's feedback. Maybe the animation is too long. But the *option* to skip is the respectful default.

## Developer Experience: Storybook DRY

While implementing this, I initially duplicated the skip logic in the Storybook story. 50+ lines of useState, useCallback, and event handlers - copy-pasted from the main component.

That's wrong. It violates DRY. When I add features to the component, I'd have to update the story too.

The fix was obvious:

```tsx
// Before: 100+ lines of duplicated logic
export const FullExperience: Story = {
  render: () => {
    const [state1, setState1] = useState(...);
    const [state2, setState2] = useState(...);
    // ... all the logic again
  },
};

// After: use the actual component
export const FullExperience: Story = {
  render: () => <SiteEvolutionJourney showHero={false} />,
};
```

Stories should test components, not reimplement them.

## New Skill: Storybook DRY

To prevent this mistake in the future, I added a Claude skill that auto-activates when working with Storybook:

**Triggers:** `storybook`, `story`, `stories`, `*.stories.tsx`

**Core rule:** Always import and render actual components. Never duplicate their logic.

It's a simple reminder, but simple reminders prevent simple mistakes.

## The UX Principle

This whole change comes down to one principle:

> **Users should always have an escape hatch.**

Animations are great until they're not. Loading states are informative until they're barriers. Transitions are smooth until they're slow.

Giving users control doesn't diminish the experience - it respects their autonomy. The animation is still there for those who want it. But now, it's a choice, not a sentence.

## Impact

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Animation | Forced, ~15 seconds | Skippable with one click |
| Skip transition | N/A | Staggered fade-up (600ms total) |
| User control | None | Full |
| Repeat visit experience | Frustrating | Respectful |

## Why It Matters

Every interaction is a conversation. When users can't skip an animation, the site is saying: *"My aesthetic is more important than your time."*

That's not a message I want to send.

The best UX is invisible. Users who want the animation get it. Users who don't, skip it. Neither group thinks about it - which means the UX is working.

That's respect.
