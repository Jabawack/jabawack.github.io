# Building Ask Prism: AI Components and Chain of Thought Visualization

AI interfaces are evolving. Users no longer accept black-box responses—they want transparency. They want to see the AI *thinking*.

<VideoPlayer src="/images/blog/ask-prism-ai-components/demo.mp4" alt="Ask Prism Table Assistant demo showing AI-powered chain of thought" />

[Ask Prism](https://github.com/Jabawack/ask-prism) is a document analytics platform I built to explore this space. Upload a PDF, ask a question, get an answer with **visual citations**—click a citation and the PDF scrolls to the exact passage, highlighted with bounding boxes.

But the real experiment was the UI layer: how do you visualize AI reasoning in a way that builds trust?

## The Problem with AI Interfaces

Most AI chat interfaces follow the same pattern: user types, AI responds, text appears. The interaction feels like talking to a wall that occasionally talks back.

This creates problems:

| Issue | User Impact |
|-------|-------------|
| **No visibility into processing** | Users don't know if the AI is working or stuck |
| **No explainability** | Answers appear without reasoning |
| **No verification** | Users can't check if the answer is accurate |
| **No grounding** | Responses float without connection to source material |

Ask Prism tackles all four.

## Chain of Thought Visualization

The chain of thought component shows AI reasoning steps in real-time. I've ported this component to this portfolio's [Design System](/storybook/?path=/docs/components-chainofthought--docs) so you can interact with it directly.

```tsx
<ChainOfThought defaultOpen>
  <ChainOfThoughtHeader>Processed in 4.2s</ChainOfThoughtHeader>
  <ChainOfThoughtContent>
    <ChainOfThoughtStep
      label="Analyzing query"
      description="Parsed user intent and extracted key entities"
      status="complete"
    />
    <ChainOfThoughtStep
      label="Retrieving relevant chunks"
      status="active"
    />
    <ChainOfThoughtStep
      label="Generating answer"
      status="pending"
    />
  </ChainOfThoughtContent>
</ChainOfThought>
```

The component auto-collapses when complete—inspired by ChatGPT's thinking display. Users see the work happening, then the UI cleans up.

This serves multiple purposes:

1. **Progress indication** - Users know the system is working
2. **Transparency** - The AI's approach is visible
3. **Trust building** - Showing verification steps signals rigor
4. **Educational** - Users learn how RAG systems work

## AI Elements Component Library

Ask Prism includes a comprehensive AI Elements library with 40+ components for building AI interfaces:

| Category | Components |
|----------|------------|
| **Reasoning** | Chain of thought, reasoning steps, plan display |
| **Messages** | User/assistant messages, tool calls, artifacts |
| **Verification** | Confirmation dialogs, checkpoints, test results |
| **Citations** | Inline citations, sources panel, snippets |
| **Processing** | Loaders, shimmer effects, queue displays |
| **Code** | Code blocks, terminal output, stack traces |

These components are built with [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/)—a Tailwind component library. The AI Elements extend Flowbite's patterns for AI-specific use cases.

## Visual Citations with Bounding Boxes

The killer feature: clicking a citation scrolls the PDF viewer to the exact location and highlights the source text.

How it works:

1. **PDF parsing** extracts text with position data (bounding boxes)
2. **Chunks** preserve bbox coordinates alongside text
3. **LLM response** includes citation references
4. **PDF viewer** (react-pdf-highlighter-extended) renders highlights

This solves the "hallucination verification" problem. Users can instantly check if the AI's answer matches the source.

## Multi-Model Verification Pipeline

Ask Prism doesn't trust a single model. The verification pipeline uses multiple LLMs:

```
Query → GPT-5 Mini (primary answer)
         ↓
      Claude Haiku 4.5 (verification)
         ↓
      o3 (reconciliation if disagreement)
         ↓
      Final answer with confidence score
```

Research shows dual verification achieves ~96% accuracy vs ~85% baseline. The extra latency is worth the reliability for document analysis.

## Why This Matters for AI UX

The AI interface patterns from Ask Prism apply broadly:

- **Chain of thought** for any multi-step AI process
- **Visual grounding** for any retrieval-augmented system
- **Multi-model verification** for high-stakes applications
- **Collapsible reasoning** for power users who want details

As AI moves from novelty to infrastructure, these UI patterns become table stakes. Users will expect transparency, not magic.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 + TypeScript |
| PDF Parsing | Reducto + pdfjs-dist (dual parser) |
| PDF Viewer | react-pdf + react-pdf-highlighter-extended |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector) |
| Agent Framework | LangGraph |
| Observability | LangSmith |
| Primary LLM | GPT-5 Mini |
| Verification LLM | Claude Haiku 4.5 |

## What I Learned

Building Ask Prism reinforced several principles:

1. **Transparency > Speed** - Users prefer seeing 5 seconds of reasoning over 3 seconds of silence
2. **Grounding builds trust** - Clickable citations transform skepticism into verification
3. **Component libraries compound** - 40+ AI components now ready for future projects
4. **Multi-model > single-model** - Verification catches hallucinations before users do

The project started as a document Q&A tool. It became a showcase for AI interface patterns.
