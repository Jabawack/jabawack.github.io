# This file tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing.
#
# Why we need this:
# - GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default to process static sites
# - Jekyll ignores files/folders starting with underscore (_)
# - Next.js outputs assets to _next/ folder
# - Without .nojekyll, the _next/ folder would be ignored and the site would break
#
# This file just needs to exist - its contents don't matter.
